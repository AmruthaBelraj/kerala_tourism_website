          <h1>Main Attractions</h1>
          <h3>Illikkal Kallu</h3>
          <p>One of the highest peaks in the vicinity, Illikkal Kallu comprises of three different hills- each rising to at least 4000 ft above the sea level. Boasting of mystical surroundings, hills imbued with a green blanket and an overall idyllic setting, the destination is blessed with bounteous natural bliss and is still unexploited and untapped by tourism. Above all, the sunset view as seen from the peak is absolutely riveting; the moon rises adjacently as the orange sun goes down. Also, the winding roads leading to the majestic boulders can give an adrenaline rush to all the adventure junkies.</p>
