          <h1>Kannur</h1>
          <p>Kannur is a coastal city in the south Indian state of Kerala. It was once an ancient trading port. Enduring monuments such as 16th-century St. Angelo Fort, once occupied by European colonial forces, show the city’s significant role in the spice trade. Housed in a former palace, the Arakkal Museum highlights Kerala's one Muslim royal family. The palm-fringed sands of Payyambalam Beach run along Kannur’s western shore.</p>

        <h3>Peralassery Sri Subramanya Temple</h3>
        <p>The stepwell at Peralassery Sri Subramanya Temple is the largest of its kind in Kerala. It has been so beautifully made that it is hard for a visitor to resist admiring its architecture. The steps leading to the well are numerous, and they have been made in a geometrical star-shaped design. The stepwell resembles the many baoris (stepwells) found in parts of North and West India such as Delhi, Rajasthan and Gujarat. As per the local belief, the waters of Cauvery River mysteriously make their way to the stepwell on Thula Sankramam (Tula Sankranti–Libra Solstice), thus rendering the stepwell always equipped for the devotees to take a dip and offer oblations.</p>
